```

When the alert fires, the bridge:

1. receives the Monitoring webhook (with optional HTTP Basic authentication),
2. queries Cloud Logging for unusual HTTP responses and container errors around the incident timestamp,
3. stitches in a pre-trigger stderr tail so you see what happened moments before,
4. maps the affected Cloud Run service to its owning GitHub repository (with a configurable default), and
5. posts a compact PR comment that pings `@codex` (or any handle you configure) and attaches the raw webhook payload for context.

Every comment contains three focused log extracts—pre-trigger stderr/stdout, unusual HTTP requests, and container errors—so the on-call engineer lands directly on the evidence they need.

The result is a reusable incident-notification pattern that needs only one Monitoring policy per project and still works even when no PR is currently open.

## How it fits together

```
Cloud Monitoring alert  ──▶  Cloud Run bridge  ──▶  GitHub PR comment (@codex)
                   │                   │
                   └── queries Cloud Logging for requests, errors & tail ─┘
```

## Prerequisites

* A Google Cloud project with Cloud Run, Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and Secret Manager enabled.
* A service account used by CI with **Cloud Run Admin**, **Service Account User**, **Logging Viewer**, and **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** roles so the workflow can deploy and mount secrets.
* Ensure the Cloud Run runtime service account (default compute or custom) also has **Logging Viewer** and **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** so the running container can query logs and resolve secrets.
* A GitHub personal access token with permission to comment on pull requests in the target repository (store it in the Secret Manager secret `github-token`, described below).
* A GitHub repository where you will host this code and run the CI/CD workflow.

> ℹ️  The sample app reads Basic Auth credentials from environment variables `WEBHOOK_USER` / `WEBHOOK_PASS`. If you skip them the webhook is wide open, so it is best to set them.

## 1. Configure GitHub repository secrets and variables

### Repository secrets

Create the following repository **secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret`). The deploy workflow forwards each secret to Cloud Run or to the deployment tooling as noted.

| Secret | Used for | Cloud Run env var | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PROJECT_ID` | gcloud deploy project | _n/a (deploy flag)_ | `my-gcp-project` |
| `REGION` | Cloud Run region + log filters | `REGION` | `europe-north1` |
| `GCP_SA_KEY` | Service account key (JSON) used by CI to authenticate | _n/a (auth step)_ | *(contents of the key file)* |

These are the only GitHub secrets required; runtime credentials now live in Google Secret Manager and are described below.

### Google Secret Manager secrets

Create the following secrets in Secret Manager (`Security → Secret Manager → Create Secret` or via `gcloud`). The CI/CD workflow references them by name and always deploys the latest version.

| Secret | Purpose | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `services` | Comma-separated Cloud Run service names to inspect | `svc-a,svc-b` |
| `repo-map` | JSON mapping service → GitHub repo | `{"svc-a":"OWNER/REPO_A"}` |
| `webhook-user` | Webhook Basic Auth username | `henrik` |
| `webhook-pass` | Webhook Basic Auth password | `strong-generated-value` |
| `github-token` | GitHub PAT used for PR comments | `ghp_xxx` |

Keep the `repo-map` JSON compact (no spaces or newlines) so the resulting environment variable is valid JSON.

Example creation commands (run once per secret; skip the `create` step if the secret already exists):

```bash
gcloud secrets create services --replication-policy=automatic
printf 'svc-a,svc-b' | gcloud secrets versions add services --data-file=-

gcloud secrets create repo-map --replication-policy=automatic
printf '{"svc-a":"OWNER/REPO_A"}' | gcloud secrets versions add repo-map --data-file=-

gcloud secrets create webhook-user --replication-policy=automatic
printf 'henrik' | gcloud secrets versions add webhook-user --data-file=-

gcloud secrets create webhook-pass --replication-policy=automatic
printf 'strong-generated-value' | gcloud secrets versions add webhook-pass --data-file=-

gcloud secrets create github-token --replication-policy=automatic
printf 'ghp_xxx' | gcloud secrets versions add github-token --data-file=-
```

Grant both the GitHub Actions deployer service account (the one whose key is stored in `GCP_SA_KEY`) and the Cloud Run runtime service account access to each secret:

```bash
for sa in "ci-deployer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" "PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com"; do
  for secret in services repo-map webhook-user webhook-pass github-token; do
    gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding "$secret" \
      --member="serviceAccount:${sa}" \
      --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
  done
done
```

Replace `ci-deployer@…` with your GitHub Actions service account email and update the runtime identity if you use a custom one. Granting `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` ensures both accounts can read the secret data during deployment and at runtime.

### Repository variables

Add the following repository **variables** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository variable`). They control comment formatting and log selection and can be tuned without touching secrets:
| Variable | Purpose | Default idea |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CODEX_HANDLE` | Handle to mention in PR comments | `codex`
| `DEFAULT_REPO` | Fallback `owner/repo` slug if no mapping matches | `OWNER/REPO`
| `WINDOW_MIN` | Minutes before/after an incident to query logs | `5` |
| `PRE_MIN` | Minutes of stderr/stdout tail to include before the trigger | `3` |
| `MAX_LINES` | Maximum total log lines captured | `40` |
| `MAX_CHARS` | Maximum characters included in the comment | `20000` |

> ⚠️  Update `DEFAULT_REPO` (or provide complete mappings) so the bridge never falls back to the placeholder `owner/repo` slug.

### GitHub token for PR comments

The bridge reads the GitHub PAT from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. Populate the Secret Manager secret `github-token`; the CI/CD workflow mounts it and exposes the value as `GITHUB_TOKEN` inside Cloud Run on every deploy.

> Tip: For local debugging you can export the token with `export GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=github-token)"` before running the app.

## 2. Build the log-based alert filter

Create a logs-based alerting policy in Cloud Monitoring that captures unusual HTTP statuses or obvious application errors. You can paste the filter below and adjust the service names and region as needed.

```text
(
  resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
  logName=~"projects/.*/logs/run.googleapis.com%2Frequests"
  resource.labels.location="europe-north1"
  (resource.labels.service_name="SVC_A" OR resource.labels.service_name="SVC_B")
  NOT httpRequest.userAgent:"GoogleHC"
  NOT httpRequest.requestUrl:"/health"
  (
    httpRequest.status<200 OR
    (httpRequest.status>206 AND httpRequest.status<300) OR
    (httpRequest.status>=300 AND httpRequest.status!=301 AND httpRequest.status!=302 AND httpRequest.status!=303
                               AND httpRequest.status!=304 AND httpRequest.status!=307 AND httpRequest.status!=308) OR
    httpRequest.status>=400
  )
  httpRequest.status!=404
)
OR
(
  resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
  (resource.labels.service_name="SVC_A" OR resource.labels.service_name="SVC_B")
  (
    severity>=ERROR OR
    textPayload:("Traceback" OR "Exception" OR "CRITICAL" OR "panic:") OR
    jsonPayload.message:("error" OR "exception")
  )
)
```

Attach a **webhook notification channel**. You will point it at the Cloud Run URL once the bridge is deployed. Enable Basic Auth on the channel and use the same username/password you stored in Secret Manager (`webhook-user` / `webhook-pass`).

## 3. Deploy the bridge service

### Manual deployment (optional)

To verify the setup before wiring up CI, deploy once with `gcloud` from this repo root. Ensure the Secret Manager entries described above exist, then provide the non-secret parameters as environment variables:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID="my-gcp-project"
export REGION="europe-north1"
export CODEX_HANDLE="codex"
export DEFAULT_REPO="OWNER/REPO"
export WINDOW_MIN="5"
export PRE_MIN="3"
export MAX_LINES="40"
export MAX_CHARS="20000"
```

When you run `gcloud run deploy`, reference the Secret Manager secrets so Cloud Run receives them as environment variables:

```bash
gcloud run deploy log2pr-bridge \
  --source . \
  --project "${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --region "${REGION}" \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars REGION="${REGION}",WINDOW_MIN="${WINDOW_MIN}",PRE_MIN="${PRE_MIN}",MAX_LINES="${MAX_LINES}",MAX_CHARS="${MAX_CHARS}",CODEX_HANDLE="${CODEX_HANDLE}",DEFAULT_REPO="${DEFAULT_REPO}" \
  --set-secrets CLOUD_RUN_SERVICES=services:latest,REPO_MAP_JSON=repo-map:latest,WEBHOOK_USER=webhook-user:latest,WEBHOOK_PASS=webhook-pass:latest,GITHUB_TOKEN=github-token:latest
```

If you use a custom runtime service account, append `--service-account` and make sure that account has both **Logging Viewer** and **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** roles. The identity running `gcloud` must also have `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on each secret so it can attach them during deployment.

### Automated deployment (GitHub Actions)

This repository ships with a workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. It:

1. authenticates to Google Cloud using the `GCP_SA_KEY` repository secret,
2. builds and deploys the service to Cloud Run whenever you push to `main`, and
3. wires the repository variables into standard environment variables and mounts the Secret Manager secrets (`services`, `repo-map`, `webhook-user`, `webhook-pass`, `github-token`) as Cloud Run environment variables.

You can also trigger it manually from the **Actions** tab using **Run workflow**. Ensure the service account JSON stored in `GCP_SA_KEY` belongs to the account that has the roles listed in the prerequisites.

## 4. Hook Monitoring to the bridge

After deployment grab the Cloud Run HTTPS URL and configure your Monitoring policy to send notifications to it:

1. Monitoring → Alerting → Notification channels → Webhooks → **Add new**.
2. Paste the Cloud Run URL.
3. Enable Basic authentication and fill the username/password you stored in the `webhook-user` / `webhook-pass` secrets.
4. Save and test — you should receive a 200 OK from the bridge.

Once the policy fires, the bridge will look up surrounding logs, map the affected service to a repo using `REPO_MAP_JSON`, and post a comment mentioning `@${CODEX_HANDLE}` on the latest updated pull request (open or closed).

## 5. Tuning and extensions

* **Status whitelist:** modify the log filter to allow expected statuses (e.g., 401, 403, 409) or add latency constraints (e.g., `httpRequest.latency>="3s"`).
* **Service → repo mapping:** keep the `repo-map` secret updated whenever you add new Cloud Run services so incidents always resolve to a repository.
* **Secret rotation:** because the workflow deploys the `:latest` version of each secret, rotate credentials by adding a new secret version and re-running the deploy (or pushing to `main`).
* **No PR history:** GitHub's API cannot add comments if the repository has never had a pull request. Ensure at least one PR exists (even if closed) or extend the service to open a dedicated "codex inbox" PR.
* **Pre-trigger window:** tune `PRE_MIN` when you want a longer or shorter stderr/stdout tail before the incident fires.

## Local development

You can run the bridge locally with Flask for quick iteration:

```bash
# Provide values that mirror your deployment (pull secrets from Secret Manager when possible)
export PROJECT_ID="my-gcp-project"
export REGION="europe-north1"
export SERVICES="$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=services)"
export REPO_MAP_JSON="$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=repo-map)"
export WEBHOOK_USER="$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=webhook-user)"
export WEBHOOK_PASS="$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=webhook-pass)"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=github-token)"
export DEFAULT_REPO="OWNER/REPO"
export PRE_MIN="3"

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="${PROJECT_ID}" GITHUB_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN}" WEBHOOK_USER="${WEBHOOK_USER}" WEBHOOK_PASS="${WEBHOOK_PASS}" \
       REGION="${REGION}" CLOUD_RUN_SERVICES="${SERVICES}" REPO_MAP_JSON="${REPO_MAP_JSON}" \
       DEFAULT_REPO="${DEFAULT_REPO}" PRE_MIN="${PRE_MIN}"
flask --app app run --debug
```

Send a sample request to `http://localhost:5000/alert` with the Monitoring webhook payload to test parsing.

---

With the alert, Cloud Run bridge, and GitHub workflow in place, any suspicious behavior in Cloud Run will immediately page `@codex` on the most recent pull request, backed by the log snippets you need for triage.
